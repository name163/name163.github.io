                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Brief</h2>
                <p class="project_text">In Design 243 - Design and Assistive Technologies, 
                    our task was to create a solution for people with disabilities. 
                    Our group chose to focus on respiratory diseases, such as asthma, 
                    as they significantly impact the lives of many individuals. 
                    Chronic respiratory conditions can affect a person's quality of life in various ways, 
                    and if left untreated, they can cause permanent damage to the airways.

                    With the recent surge and decline of COVID-19, 
                    respiratory health has become an even more pressing concern. Respiratory infections, 
                    such as coronavirus, are more severe for individuals with asthma, 
                    as they can lead to pneumonia and asthma attacks. While wearing surgical masks can reduce the risk of infection, 
                    they often restrict airflow, which is a significant drawback for asthma patients.
                    
                    Our project aimed to address this issue by developing an automated mask that dispenses Budesonide, 
                    a medication that relaxes the airway muscles, making it easier to breathe. 
                    The mask is designed to be lightweight and made from polycarbonate, 
                    a thermoplastic commonly used in the medical field for its ease of sanitization. 
                    Additionally, the mask incorporates a pressure sensor to monitor and analyze the user's breathing patterns continuously and accurately.</p>

                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Role and contribution</h2>
                <p class="project_text">As the tech lead within the group, 
                    my primary role was to create the prototype and implement functional hardware, 
                    such as a heart rate monitor, for the final showcase. 
                    I was responsible for designing and troubleshooting the technical aspects of the project, 
                    including the integration of sensors and the development of the user interface.</p>

                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Process and Methodology</h2>
                <p class="project_text">For this project, we found that the SPRINT methodology was the most suitable approach. 
                    This methodology encourages original thinking, creativity, and rapid iteration, 
                    which was essential given the project's timeline. 
                    Additionally, the SPRINT methodology allowed us to prototype ideas early on before scaling them up, saving time, resources, and costs.

                    We divided the SPRINT process into five phases: planning, scoping, prototyping, 
                    feedback, and final iteration. 
                    This structured approach enabled us to stay organized and focused while iterating on our design effectively.</p>

            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
                <p class="project_text">During the development of the prototype, 
                    I encountered several challenges. One major issue was with the 3D model of the mask, 
                    which either did not print properly or was uncomfortable to wear due to sizing issues. 
                    To address this, we adjusted the design details to make it easier to print and slightly enlarged the model to improve comfort.

                    Another challenge was creating the interface for the heart rate monitor. 
                    As I had no prior experience with Arduinos, 
                    it took me significant time to familiarise myself with the syntax and troubleshoot connectivity issues. 
                    Eventually, I discovered that the problem was due to incorrect port settings in the code, 
                    as I had referenced documentation for a different Arduino board. Once I corrected this, the heart rate monitor worked as intended.
                    
                    Finally, integrating the heart rate monitor into the 3D-printed mask proved difficult due to its clunky design and power supply requirements. 
                    As a result, we decided to display the heart rate monitor separately alongside the mask for the final showcase.</p>

            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Results and Impact</h2>
                <p class="project_text">The final prototype consisted of a lightweight, 
                    3D-printed mask made from polycarbonate and a separate heart rate monitor to track respiratory patterns. 
                    While the mask itself was functional and comfortable, the heart rate monitor could not be fully integrated due to technical limitations.

                    Our project highlighted the potential of assistive technologies to improve the lives of individuals with respiratory conditions. 
                    By combining medication delivery with real-time respiratory monitoring, 
                    our design offers a promising solution to mitigate the challenges faced by asthma patients, particularly in the context of infectious diseases like COVID-19.</p>

            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Reflection</h2>
                <p class="project_text">Overall, the project was a valuable learning experience, 
                    though there is room for improvement. 
                    With more time, we could have developed a high-fidelity prototype with fully integrated electronics, 
                    rather than displaying them separately.

                    This project deepened my understanding of hardware integration and prototyping, 
                    particularly with Arduino and 3D printing. Now that I am more familiar with Arduino, 
                    I am confident in my ability to create better interfaces in less time, 
                    allowing for more seamless integration into future designs.
                    
                    The experience also reinforced the importance of adaptability and problem-solving in design. Despite the challenges, 
                    we were able to deliver a functional prototype that met the project's objectives and demonstrated the potential of our solution.</p>
