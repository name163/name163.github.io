                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Brief</h2>
                <p class="project_text">In COMPSCI 235, we focused on web development methodologies such as Scrum and Agile. 
                    As part of the course, we were tasked with creating a game library website using HTML and CSS, 
                    and integrating a database using the Flask framework in Python.

                    This project aimed to simulate real-world software development by applying Agile principles 
                    and working collaboratively in a team. 
                    Our goal was to deliver a functional, user-friendly website with a robust backend database system.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Role and contribution</h2>
                <p class="project_text">I worked in a group of three, 
                    and my primary responsibilities included integrating the database into the website using Flask 
                    and writing unit tests to ensure the website functioned as intended using pytest.

                    I was also involved in debugging, code reviews, 
                    and ensuring the database interactions were seamless and efficient. 
                    My contributions were critical to the backend functionality and overall reliability of the website.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Process and Methodology</h2>
                <p class="project_text">Our group chose to use the Scrum methodology, 
                    as it allowed us to break the project into smaller, manageable tasks and set clear deadlines for each component. 
                    We divided the project into smaller parts, assigned tasks based on individual strengths, and set weekly goals.

                    Every week, we reconvened to review progress, merge code into the main branch, 
                    and deploy the updated version after ensuring the code met our quality standards. 
                    This iterative approach helped us deliver the project efficiently and maintain a high standard of work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
                <p class="project_text">One of the main challenges I faced was integrating the database with the website using Flask. 
                    As this was my first time using a framework to connect a database to a website, 
                    I encountered several issues with limited documentation available for specific problems. 
                    I spent a significant amount of time researching and debugging to resolve these issues.

                    Another challenge was writing unit tests for the database, 
                    particularly for functionalities like user login and database queries. 
                    This required a deep understanding of pytest and careful planning to ensure all edge cases were covered. 
                    I dedicated the second half of the project to tackling these challenges, which ultimately improved the reliability of the website.</p>  
            </div>

            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Results and Impact</h2>
                <p class="project_text">By the end of the project, 
                    we successfully delivered a fully functional game library website with a seamless database integration. 
                    The website allowed users to browse games, log in, and interact with the database efficiently.

                    The use of Scrum ensured that we met all deadlines and maintained a high standard of work throughout the project. 
                    The unit tests I wrote helped identify and fix potential issues early, 
                    resulting in a stable and reliable final product.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Reflection</h2>
                <p class="project_text">This project was a valuable learning experience 
                    that deepened my understanding of software development processes, 
                    particularly backend development using Flask. 
                    I gained hands-on experience with database integration, 
                    unit testing, and working in a Scrum team environment.

                    The challenges I faced, such as debugging and writing comprehensive unit tests, 
                    helped me develop problem-solving skills and resilience. 
                    Additionally, collaborating with my teammates improved my communication and teamwork abilities, 
                    which are essential for real-world software development.
                    
                    Overall, this project provided a solid foundation in backend development and Agile methodologies, 
                    preparing me for future challenges in the field.</p>
