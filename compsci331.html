                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Brief</h2>
                <p class="project_text">In COMPSCI 331 - Large-Scale Software Development, 
                    we built upon the knowledge gained in COMPSCI 235, 
                    delving deeper into software architecture and the components of large-scale software systems. 
                    The project involved developing a JAX-RS web service for concert booking, starting from a provided template.

                    This project aimed to simulate real-world large-scale software development, 
                    focusing on backend development, collaboration, and the implementation of robust web services.</p>

            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Role and contribution</h2>
                <p class="project_text">As part of a team of backend developers, my contributions included:

                    <ul class="project_list">
                        <li>Creating the Performer domain without annotations.</li>
                        <li>Implementing ConcertMapper and PerformerMapper.</li>
                        <li>Fixing errors such as DATE not found in CONCERT_DATES and IMAGE_NAME column not found in CONCERT.</li>
                        <li>Conducting minor bug fixes in ConcertResources and domain models.</li>
                        <li>Engaging in team discussions and attempting to implement cookies.</li>
                        <li>Fully implementing the /subscribe/concertInfo endpoint.</li>
                        <li>Implementing subscription/publish functionality.</li>
                        <li>Adding helper methods for requestBooking and requestSubscription.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    These tasks required a strong understanding of Java, JAX-RS, and database integration, 
                    and I collaborated closely with my team to ensure the functionality aligned with the project requirements.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Process and Methodology</h2>
                <p class="project_text">Since our team had previously worked together in COMPSCI 235, 
                    we were familiar with each other's strengths and weaknesses. We decided to reuse the Scrum methodology, 
                    which had proven effective in our prior project.

                    We broke the project into smaller tasks, assigned deadlines, 
                    and divided the work based on individual expertise. After a week of individual work, 
                    we reconvened to review the code, refactor as needed, and merge the completed parts into the main branch for deployment. 
                    This iterative approach ensured efficient progress and high-quality deliverables.</p>

            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
                <p class="project_text">One of the main challenges I faced was debugging near the end of the project. 
                    The codebase was complex and somewhat difficult to follow, 
                    especially since I was less familiar with Java compared to Python, which we used in the previous project.

                    To overcome this, I spent additional time studying the code structure and debugging systematically. 
                    I also sought help from teammates and online resources to resolve issues efficiently. 
                    This experience improved my debugging skills and deepened my understanding of Java.</p>  
            </div>

            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Results and Impact</h2>
                <p class="project_text">By the end of the project, 
                    we successfully developed a fully functional concert booking web service. 
                    The service allowed users to book concerts, subscribe to concert updates, 
                    and interact with the system seamlessly.

                    The use of Scrum ensured that we met all deadlines and maintained a high standard of work. 
                    My contributions, particularly in fixing critical errors and implementing key functionalities, 
                    played a significant role in the project's success.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project_wrapper">
                <h2 class="project_subtitle">Reflection</h2>
                <p class="project_text">This project was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my understanding of Java, 
                    JAX-RS, and large-scale software development. I gained hands-on experience in backend development, 
                    debugging complex systems, and collaborating effectively in a team.

                    The challenges I faced, such as debugging unfamiliar code and adapting to a new programming language, 
                    helped me develop resilience and problem-solving skills. 
                    Additionally, working with the same team from COMPSCI 235 strengthened our collaboration and communication, 
                    making the development process smoother.
                    
                    Overall, 
                    this project deepened my technical expertise and prepared me for future challenges in large-scale software development.</p>
